      "input": "Scarpinato's Cucina and Catering - We went with a party of 16 for Christmas Eve.  We had our own room right off the main dining room.  From the moment we arrived, I was really impressed.  Our tables were provided baskets of bread, oil/garlic dip, peppers and cheese.  All were delicious.  We had Michelle as the our waitress (yes, 1 waitress for a party of 16) and she nailed it.  What a great, friendly personality.  She was thorough and spot on with every order.  Not one mistake.  Even when the food was served, she was there to tell exactly who the meal belonged to.  I can't say enough positive things about Michelle or the entire staff who assisted.\n\nNow for the food.  Oh My Goodness!!  The portion size was huge.  I had the seafood pescatore.  It was mussels, clams, scallops, shrimp and crab meat served over linguine in a white sauce.  It was delicious.  The taste was amazing.  The sauce was perfect for bread dipping also!!  Not sure what everyone ordered in our party, but everyone raved about how good their meal was.\n\nI personally didn't have room for dessert, but the few that did talked about how great that was too.  \n\nI've never heard of or been here before but I will definitely be back! | Our server was pretty good and sweet and she took care of us, however some members of the staff had a nasty attitude and completely ignored us when we asked one of them to take a quick picture of us. The food is also overpriced, for a $30 plate of pasta I had high expectations, but the food was just average. I honestly think there is better options out there for Italian food. | Fettuccini Carbonatta and Scallops wrapped in Bacon. I did a takeout and was pleased with the service and the quality of the food. Large volume of food that created 3 meals for me. Portions are quite large and were well done.",

Had Shrimp Enchiladas, very nice.  The food is lite and very tasty.\nFor dessert had the Pastel do Limon also lite and refreshing.  They serve pre mixed Margaritas which were not bad.
